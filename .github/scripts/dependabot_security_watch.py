"""Report Dependabot security pull requests stuck against `main`.

Dependabot security updates do not honour `target-branch`; they open against
the default branch, which here is `main`. `main-guard` refuses any pull
request into `main` whose source is not `develop`, so a security bump lands
with a red check and then sits open, and nothing anywhere says so. That is
#676. The decision recorded there is to keep `target-branch: develop` and
`main-guard` exactly as they are, re-land every security bump by hand off
`develop`, and make the stuck state loud instead of silent. This script is
the loud part.

Usage:
  gh pr list --repo R --base main --state open \\
      --json number,title,author,headRefName,createdAt \\
      | dependabot_security_watch.py
  dependabot_security_watch.py <file.json>

Input is the JSON list that `gh pr list` prints, read from stdin or from the
file argument. A pull request counts as stuck when Dependabot authored it and
its head is not `develop`. A Dependabot pull request whose head IS `develop`
is a release pull request someone opened on its behalf, not a stuck one.

The author login arrives in two shapes depending on the gh version: the older
user-shaped `dependabot[bot]` and the newer app-shaped `app/dependabot`. Both
are accepted; a login that matches neither is not Dependabot.

Exit codes:
  0  nothing stuck
  1  at least one stuck pull request; each is listed with its number, title
     and age in days, followed by the re-land procedure
  2  the input could not be read or is not a list of pull requests
